My team's paper titled, "A Tiny CNN Architecture for Medical Face Mask Detection for Resource-Constrained Endpoints", was recently accepted for publications in the 2021 International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Springer LNEE). Here we used an ARM Cortex M7 based device and a small camera to detect medical face masks using CNNs.
