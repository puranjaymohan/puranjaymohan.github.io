- I have been contributing to the Linux kernel since my sophomore year.
- My interests are related to hardware and embedded systems so, I have made contributions to the IIO Subsystem.
- My best contributions are the driver for TMP117 temperature sensor and ADXL355 Accelerometer.
- I also contribute to PCI subsystem and Documentation.
