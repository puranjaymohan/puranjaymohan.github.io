- Worked on adding the support of Latency Tolerance Reporting <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.plda.com/pcie-glossary/ltr#:~:text=LTR%20(Latency%20Tolerance%20Reporting)%20is,and%20other%20resources%20associated%20with" target="_blank">LTR</a> to Linux Kernel's PCI Subsystem.
- The Linux kernel doesn't query the PCIe devices for thier latency requirements and hence it causes power losses.
- My code can be seen here :- <a class="inline-link" href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20201001214436.2735412-1-helgaas@kernel.org/" target="_blank">LTR Patch</a>
