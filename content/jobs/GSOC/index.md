- Working on an IIO Driver for Analog Devices' <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl355.html" class="inline-link" target="_blank">ADXL355 Accelerometer.</a>
- My work involves writing the driver using IIO subsystem APIs, sending patches to kernel mailing lists, receiving feedback from maitainers, and making changes.
- The hardware setup involves a raspberry pi 4 which has two ADXL355 sensors connected to it through SPI and I2C.
- Learning outcomes:- IIO, Regmap, I2C, SPI, and other subsystems.
